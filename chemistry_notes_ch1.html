        <h3>Corrosion</h3>
        <p>When a metal is attacked by the substances around it such as moisture, acids etc., it is said to be corrode
            and the process is called Corrosion.</p>
            <p>Ex- Rusting of metal, Blackening of silver etc.</p>

        <h3>Rancidity</h3>
        <p>The process of oxidation of fats and oils present in the food items, result in change in taste and smell, is
            called rencidity.</p>

        <h2>Methods to prevent rancidity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Packing food items in air-tight containers.</li>
            <li>By adding anti-oxidants to fat/oil containing food.</li>
            <li>It can also be retarted by storing food items away from heat and light.</li>
